Morton Feldman: ”I’m involved in a political life. I'm involved in a revolutionary life. Any time I want to get up in the morning I'm making a revolution. I'm making either a revolution against history by deciding to write a certain type of music, or I'm making a revolution even against my own history. Many times I've put myself up against the wall and shot myself. I'm into a continual perpetual revolution in my own personal response to my work, which means action, immediate action, immediate decision that only I can make, and that I have to be responsible for.”

MF: “I feel that the young people, and this is also related to the whole sociological change, the young people just don't want to compete. That's a big mistake amongst young people now anyway.”

Walter Zimmerman: “Because they have seen where competition leads.”

MF: “I had to bring myself into a certain creative pressure, and concentration. But what I do is what I mean, not just some idea that is gonna knock off in the afternoon. The word competition is not right. But I was perhaps one of the last survivors in a kind of art arena. And I think the young people are not in an arena ... You see it comes from within. They think about society because they are directed by society. And they get their cues from society. And when society says, "Well, that needs changing!" they cannot be oblivious to this change. I think the big problem in a sense is that they've been victimized and manipulated by society. And their whole thinking in a sense apes, reflects society in terms of what they want to manipulate. So they are not competing with art. They are competing with society. And the values of society. Remember, society changes. To compete with art is like competing with life. It's too much of a force. The dynamic is too powerful. Understand? It's like jumping into a volcano.”

MF: “You see, the difference between America and Europe in the relation to the Garden of Eden could be best explained by Voltaire. Let's say Voltaire is Europe. You can't be more Europe than Voltaire. And let's take a book like Candide. In Candide there were three gardens. Each one, the first two were very sublime. In the first he discovered making love to somebody else's wife. And he's thrown out of that garden, down the steps. Next we find him in Eldorado, also the Garden of Eden. And he finally has to leave there. And in the end he's in a little garden outside of Constantinople with a lot of junk.”

MF: “To take a militant attitude towards society means that you're involved with that aspect of society. You're not involved with life. To take a militant action in relation to life, that's more mysterious. That needs thought. To me, I took a militant attitude towards sounds. I wanted sounds to be a metaphor, that they could be as free as a human being might be free. That was my idea about sound. It still is, that they should breathe ... not to be used for the vested interest of an idea. I feel that music should have no vested interests, that you shouldn't know how it's made, that you shouldn't know if there's a system, that you shouldn't know anything about it ... except that it's some kind of life force that to some degree really changes your life ... if you're into it.”

MF: “And I think that whole business of control is very important. One wants to be in control of society, one wants to be in control of art. One wants to be in control, control, control. Now, just because the control is for something that's on the good side, it's still control. ... See, when you get into society, you see, the big dilemma in society I think was expressed beautifully by Camus, where he says that one man, when he desires freedom, will be at the expense of others. In other words, one man's freedom makes someone else a victim. You understand? And I feel the same way in music, that if you're idealistic, and you insist that music be a certain way, then it's at the expense of the music. If you use the music for means, then it becomes a polemical thing.”

…

MF: “The big problem is that we have to differentiate too between culture and art. Art is done just by a few people. Culture is the manifestation. Publishers, students, teachers is culture. I'm a volunteer of culture, not art. And one of the things about culture, and I feel the young people are more aligned to culture, which again is society, than they are to the other things. Because in culture one has to have the illusion that one understands. You see?”
